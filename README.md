What does HAniS do? It is a tool you can employ on your web pages that provides the ability to animate a sequence of individual images. It also lets you use overlays and provides many options for creating "hotspots", probing data, and the like. This version is coded entirely in JavaScript and uses the HTML5 standards so is usable on multiple platforms with modern browsers.
